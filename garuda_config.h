 * Two advances, one of them duty-corrupted, = the regen.
 * FIX: keep the ONE clean mechanism (the timing-advance schedule, a direct
 * angle/time advance, duty-independent) and TUNE it. timingAdvMaxDeg is a live
 * GSP param -> sweep the high-speed advance at the bench with no rebuild.
 *
 * UPDATE 2026-06-13c: comp RE-ENABLED with the fix the note above asked for —
 * it now uses a TRUE MEASURED BEMF amplitude (bemf.bemfDevPeak: peak
 * |float-neutral| per sector, garuda_service.c) instead of zcThreshold. That

 *
 *   - Raise ω_n → faster tracking, more sensitivity to capture jitter
 *   - Raise ζ   → more damping (less overshoot, slower settle)
 *
 * Standard relationships for the discrete tracking-PI we use:
 *
 *   Kp = 2ζω_n           ← proportional (transient response)
 *   Ki = ω_n²            ← integral     (steady-state tracking)
 *
 * ω_n is expressed in rad per sample-period (one PI sector event), so
 * the absolute Hz bandwidth scales with rotor speed:
 *   f_n(Hz) = ω_n × sector_rate / (2π)
 *   At 14k eRPM (sector rate 1400Hz): f_n =  ~56 Hz
 *   At 230k eRPM (sector rate 23kHz): f_n = ~915 Hz
 * This is a desirable property for sensorless motor tracking — the loop
 * naturally widens its bandwidth when the rotor is fast and tightens it
 * when slow, matching the rotor's dynamic timescale.
 *
 * Bench-validated combination (= original Kp=0.25, Ki=0.0625):
 *   ω_n = 0.25  (slow tracking)

 *
 * 2026-06-06 root cause: per-sector miss telemetry proved the rising-ZC sectors
 * (even 0/2/4) NEVER miss at any speed, while the falling-ZC sectors (odd 1/3/5)
 * carry 100% of the guesses, speed-progressively (clean at idle → fully masked
 * ≥90k eRPM, a perfect 50% measured). The two polarities sit under opposite
 * freewheel/demag conditions, so the SYMMETRIC offset (rising thresh−offset,
 * falling thresh+offset) over-shifts falling: as ω grows the falling CMPLO is
 * pushed toward 4095 until the downward crossing can't register.
 *
 * This scales ONLY the falling-branch offset (rising still uses
 * HWZC_FILTER_AMP_PCT). 0 = falling filter-comp OFF (first bench point — confirm
 * via tools/analyze_sectors.py that odd-sector misses collapse). If falling
 * recovers but tops out below rising, sweep this UP (e.g. 15, 25) toward the
 * sweet spot. If misses DON'T collapse at 0, the masking is physical (ON-time
 * window can't see the falling crossing at speed) → per-polarity SAMPLE POINT,
 * not a threshold tweak. Rising at AMP_PCT=50 is bench-proven to 232k — leave it.
 *
 * 2026-06-06 BENCH RESULT: set to 0 (falling comp OFF) — per-sector telemetry
 * showed ZERO change (odd sectors still 100% of guesses, still 50% measured
 * ≥90k). This REFUTED the offset hypothesis. Reject count (~650) ≪ falling
 * misses (10,223) at ≥90k proved the falling sectors are SILENT (comparator
 * never crosses), not firing-and-rejected → pure visibility problem. Restored
 * to 50 (symmetric, identical to the proven 232k build). The knob stays for the
 * eventual per-polarity SAMPLE-POINT fix; filter-comp is NOT that fix. */

 * Why eRPM, not period?
 *   - Plant gain in (eRPM, duty_ticks) is constant: 3.2 eRPM/tick across the
 *     14k–230k eRPM range. Constant-gain plant + constant-gain PI = uniform
 *     loop dynamics at every operating point.
 *   - Plant gain in (period, duty) varies as 1/ω² — 16× difference between
 *     idle and top. PI tuned for one extreme blows up at the other.
 *   - Costs one FPU division per PI event to compute measured_eRPM from
 *     stepPeriodHR. Negligible on dsPIC33AK FPU.
 *
 * Why feedforward?
 *   - Without it, integrator alone has to build up to operating duty (6-89%).
 *     At idle's slow event rate, this takes seconds.
 *   - Linear duty(eRPM) fit from bench data covers 95%+ of the steady-state
 *     duty. PI only has to trim the residual ±1-2%. Much faster convergence.
 *
 * Why deadband?
 *   - HWZC capture noise is bimodal: 3-4% in the mid range, 10% at extremes.
 *   - Per-event Kp × noise causes the PI to chase its own noise → limit cycle.
 *   - 3% deadband on the eRPM error suppresses noise hunting while leaving
 *     real load disturbances (>3% deviation) free to drive the loop.
 *
 * Calibration (re-measure for a different motor or supply voltage):
 *   - SPEED_PI_FF_SLOPE/OFFSET: fit duty(eRPM) from a bench sweep
 *   - SPEED_PI_TARGET_ERPM_IDLE/MAX: choose throttle endpoints
 *   - Gains tuned for plant K=3.2 eRPM/tick (which holds across speeds)
 *
 * Default ON (FEATURE_SPEED_PI=1).
